## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

We follow standard JavaScript conventions with these specifics:

#### General

- Use ES6+ features (const, let, arrow functions, etc.)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

#### Naming Conventions

```javascript
// Classes: PascalCase
class SQLToDocxExtension {}

// Functions/Methods: camelCase
function executeQuery() {}

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_ROWS_DEFAULT = 10;

// Private methods: prefix with underscore
_privateMethod() {}

// Async functions: clearly indicate with async keyword
async function fetchData() {}
```

#### Comments

```javascript
/**
 * Multi-line JSDoc comments for functions
 * @param {string} query - The SQL query to execute
 * @param {number} maxRows - Maximum rows to return
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Query results
 */
async function executeQuery(query, maxRows) {
  // Single-line comments for inline explanations
  const result = await connection.query(query);
  return result;
}
```

#### Error Handling

```javascript
// Always use try-catch for async operations
try {
  const result = await executeQuery(query);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  this.log(`Error executing query: ${error.message}`);
  throw error; // Re-throw if caller should handle
}
```

#### Async/Await

```javascript
// Prefer async/await over promises
async function getData() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return processData(data);
}

// Not this:
function getData() {
  return fetchData()
    .then(data => processData(data));
}
```

### VS Code Extension Best Practices

- Use `vscode.window.withProgress` for long operations
- Dispose resources properly in `deactivate()`
- Use output channels for logging
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Respect user settings and configuration
- Use activation events to minimize startup impact

### File Organization

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in `test/` directory
- Name test files: `*.test.js`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies (SQL Server, file system)

**Example Test:**

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const vscode = require('vscode');

suite('Extension Test Suite', () => {
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Start all tests.');

  test('Parse queries correctly', () => {
    const input = 'SELECT * FROM Users; SELECT * FROM Orders;';
    const expected = ['SELECT * FROM Users', 'SELECT * FROM Orders'];
    const actual = parseQueries(input);
    assert.deepStrictEqual(actual, expected);
  });

  test('Handle empty input', () => {
    const input = '';
    const expected = [];
    const actual = parseQueries(input);
    assert.deepStrictEqual(actual, expected);
  });
});
```
